                <p>
                    Space exploration is the investigation of outer space using space technology and astronomy.
                    It has provided us with incredible discoveries about the universe, from the Moon landings to
                    the exploration of Mars and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans have been fascinated with the cosmos for centuries, and space exploration has allowed us
                    to satisfy our curiosity about what lies beyond our home planet, Earth.

            <h2>The Solar System</h2>
            <p>
                Our solar system is home to various planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. Each of these
                heavenly bodies has its own unique characteristics and properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, Jupiter is the largest planet, and it's famous for its massive storm known as the
                Great Red Spot. Saturn, on the other hand, is known for its beautiful ring system.
