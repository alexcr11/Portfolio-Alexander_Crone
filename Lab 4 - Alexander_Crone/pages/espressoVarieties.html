                <p>
                    Café con Leche, a beloved Spanish coffee, combines the rich flavor of espresso with the creamy
                    embrace of steamed milk. This harmonious blend creates a coffee experience like no other, often
                    savored as a breakfast treat.

                <p>
                    Turkish coffee stands out for its unique brewing method. Finely ground coffee is simmered in water
                    with sugar and aromatic cardamom, creating an unfiltered, intense coffee experience that's steeped
                    in tradition.

                    This coffee is traditionally served in small cups, and what makes it truly distinctive is the
                    grounds that settle at the bottom, allowing for fortune telling—a fascinating part of Turkish coffee
                    culture. Each cup is a journey into history and storytelling.
