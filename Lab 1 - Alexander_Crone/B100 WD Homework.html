        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>HTML is like the backbone of the web. It's the language that structures the content of web pages. With HTML,
            you get to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. It's pretty much like creating the skeleton
            of a webpage, which is kind of cool!</p>
        <p>You'll start using tags like &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; to organize content.
            It's not exactly a programming language, but it's the very first step in becoming a web developer. Exciting,
            right?</p>

        <h1>HTML5</h1>
        <p>HTML5 is like the hip big brother of HTML. It's the latest version and brings some really awesome features to
            the web. You can do cool things like embedding videos and audio directly into your webpage, which is pretty
            amazing!</p>
        <p>But the coolest part is the &lt;canvas&gt; element. It lets you draw graphics right on your webpage, and
            there are also improved form controls to make user interactions smoother. HTML5 is kind of like the future
            of the web - it's all about enhancing the user experience.</p>

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>CSS is like the fashion designer for your webpage. It's all about making things look good and stylish. With
            CSS, you can change colors, fonts, layouts, and even add some fancy animations. It's like having a palette
            of colors and brushes for web designers!</p>
        <p>Imagine starting with a plain webpage. CSS is the tool that can transform it into something amazing. You can
            make text bold, give buttons a pop of color, and arrange elements neatly. CSS adds that 'wow' factor that
            makes websites look polished and professional.</p>
